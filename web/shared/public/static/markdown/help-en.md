<div style="margin-left: 20px">
<br>
This website is designed for tierers who do not have a secondary account or device during events.<br>
Use this website to track the hourly progress of tierers and event borders.<br>
You can also utilize this service to plan for future events by analyzing the performance of other tierers.<br><br>

All you need to do is open the website on your PC — it will automatically refresh the scoreboard every minute.<br>
It is not recommended to use this website on your smartphones as there is an excessive amount of data being rendered on your screen.<br>

The website is built to refresh the scoreboard automatically, so manual refreshing is not necessary.<br>
Simply open the website and keep the page active.<br>
Note that the scoreboard data is not real-time. manually refreshing the page will not make a difference.<br><br>

* <b><u>Event Information</u></b>: Name of the current event is displayed here.<br>
* <b><u>External Links</u></b>: Official Project Sekai services and all services from sekai.run are kept here.

<br>

##### > Top-left

* <b><u>Search Nickname</u></b>: You may search tierers' nicknames through the <b><u>Search Nickname</u></b> textbox.
* <b><u>Bookmarks</u></b>: You may check useful informative articles for event runs.
* <b><u>Settings</u></b>: You can change scoreboard display options and languages from this menu.

##### > Scoreboard

<img src="/static/help/scoreboard2.png" alt="scoreboard" class="help-image">

* The scoreboard displays the current rank, leader card, nickname, and score by default.<br>
  If you want to change the displayed information, you can do so in the <b>"Settings"</b> menu.

* The top progress bar area indicates how much the event has been progressed<br>
  and how many days/hours are remaining until the event is over.

* The portion displayed in <span class="text-success">green</span> represents the score the tierer has gained in the past hour. (Tierer's speed per hour)<br>
  Looking at the example image, you can see that the 2nd place tierer has gained 2,243,885 EP in the past hour.<br>
  A tierer who newly enters the top 100 is marked with <span class="text-danger">NEW!!</span>.

* The portion displayed in <span class="text-info">blue</span> represents the score the border has increased by in the past hour. (Border speed per hour)<br>
  Lower-ranked tierers who want to catch up with higher-ranked tierers should carefully consider the blue score and green score to track the progress and plan their run.

* Emojis appear below the rankings based on the tierer's speed per hour.<br>
  * For normal events:<br>

* Clicking on a tierer allows you to see their profile and event progress.

<br>

##### > Profile

<img src="/static/help/profile.png" alt="profile" class="help-image">

* You can see the tierer's nickname, deck, stats, and event progress.

* The terms displayed in the deck information mean the following:
  * <b>Lv.</b>: Level
  * <b>MR</b>: Master Rank
  * <b>LEADER</b>: Leader
  * <b>SUB</b>: Sub-leader<br><br>

* Event Progress
  * You can analyze the tierer's activity trends with the progress graph.
    * If the tierer is taking a break, the graph will appear as a flat horizontal line.
    * If there is a very steep upward slope, it is likely that the tierer is playing in a pre-arranged server or in a continuous twitter-recruited room.
    * If the slope is less steep than the previous case but still steadily increasing, the tierer might be playing on auto mode.
    * If the speed of increase is irregular but still follows an upward trend, the tierer is likely playing in a twitter recruited room or in random rooms.
  * Border Prediction Graph
    * The final border is predicted based on past event run data and growth patterns.
    * This is a mathematically calculated estimate and should be used for reference only.
    * The developer is not responsible for any issues arising from the use of this data.
    * <u><b>Please note that the prediction borders of WL overalls will NOT be displayed.<br>Please consider checking chapter-wise predictions.</b></u>
  * IMPORTANT NOTE
    * If a tierer falls out of the top 100, data collection will stop.
    * If a tierer re-enters back to top 100, data collection will resume.
    * Even if the tierer re-enters the ranking, past data is retained and displayed in the progress chart.
    * (For World Link) Clicking on characters next to "Overall" will show the graph for character chapters.<br>

<img src="/static/help/profile-score-speed-2.png" alt="profile-score-speed" class="help-image">

* Average EP per hour<br>
  You can see the average EP/h based on the entire event, the past 24 hours, or the past hour.<br>
  You may also estimate EP/day by clicking the option button.

* Last 1 hour<br>
  You can view information of the runner's current hourly speed and score/G over the past hour.<br>
  Scores that are considered normal are shown in green, while scores that appear lower than usual are shown in yellow or red.

* Run Analysis<br>
  Displays the complete running history based on the records stored on the server.

#### Usage for advanced users

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 20px">

##### > Overtake Mode

* You can see how long it will take for the selected tierer to overtake another tierer.<br>
  On the other hand, you can also see how long it will take for another tierer to catch up to the selected tierer.<br>
  This feature helps you to plan how much further you need to run or take a break.

* After enabling the "Overtake Mode" option in the settings, click the profile of the tierer you want to set as the reference tierer.<br>
  The speed and border speed on the scoreboard will switch to overtake mode.<br>

<img src="/static/help/overtake-example-1.png" alt="profile" class="help-image">

* First example:<br>
  The 13th place, set as the reference, is currently running at 1.1m EP/h.<br>
  The 12th place is running at 194k EP/h.</br>
  If the pace continues, it will take approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes to catch up the 12th place,<br>
  and about 3 hours to catch up the 11th place.

<img src="/static/help/overtake-example-2.png" alt="profile" class="help-image">

* Second example:<br>
  The 4th place, set as the reference, is currently running at 1.7m EP/h.<br>
  The 3rd place tierer is running at 1m EP/h. However, the gap has already widened to much.<br>
  If the current pace continues, it will take more than a day for 4th place to catch up the 3rd place.<br>
  This confirms that a "wall" of more than one day has already formed between 3rd and 4th place.<br>
  Since the 2nd place is running faster than the 4th place, it is impossible to catch up, and therefore the time is not being displayed.<br>
  Similarly, you can also see how long it will take for lower-ranked tierers to overtake the reference tierer.<br>
  For example, the 5th place would take 5 hours to overtake the 4th place,<br>
  while the 6th place tierer would take more than a day unless the 4th place tierer gives up his current pace.<br>

<br>

##### > Comparing between tierers

* This is a PC-exclusive feature.
* You can drag the profile of a tierer you want to compare to see speed and graph comparisons with other tierers.<br>
  (Support for World Link 2 is planned.)
* Please refer to the following video for instructions on how to use this feature.
